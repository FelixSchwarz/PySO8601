PySO8601
========

PySO8601 aims to be a better Python module to parse ISO 8601 dates. It is inspired 
by the [iso8601](http://code.google.com/p/pyiso8601) currently available in the 
[pypi repository](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601), however this module is 
designed to accept any valid ISO8601 Date or Time formatted string in addition 
to ISO8601 Duration and Interval formatted string.
